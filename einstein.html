         Photon, also known as light quantum, is a tiny energy packet of electromagnetic radiation. This concept originated in Albert Einsteins explanation of the photoelectric effect, in which he proposed the existence of discrete energy packets during the transmission of light. Albert Einstein was best known for his General and Special theory of relativity and the concept of mass-energy equivalence (E = mc2.)
