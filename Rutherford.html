               Ernest Rutherford, a Zealand chemist is regarded as the “father of nuclear physics.” He was the first to propose that an atom comprises a small charged nucleus surrounded by empty space and are circled by tiny electrons which later, became known as the Rutherford model. He is credited with the discovery of protons and hypothesized the existence of the neutron.
